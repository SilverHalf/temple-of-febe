# Legendary Challenge Mode

Temple of Febe is the first encounter in Guild Wars 2 to introduce a Legendary Challenge Mode.
When this is activated, the boss' HP increases by about 24 million, reaching over 130 million HP, and several
mechanics recieve additional buffs that make them much more difficult to manage.
Cerus LCM is currently the hardest encounter in the game by far.
This is due to the difficult damage check introduced by Cerus' extra survivability, and the difficult healing
check in the final phase, which requires minimal errors in the fight up to the end. 

If you aim to clear the LCM, it is _strongly recommended_ to first clear the normal CM. The mechanics are very similar,
and building familiarity with them is extremely useful for progressing.

# Embodiment Of Sin

EoS is the title run for Temple of Febe, requiring that players kill the Challenge Mode with all
of Cerus's aspects empowered. This used to be the hardest encounter in the game, much harder than LCM.
It recently got nerfed in the [June 25 balance patch](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/topic/147775-game-update-notes-june-25-2024/),
and it remains to be seen how the meta will evolve and how difficult it will be.

Minas' dedicated guide for the old version of the encounter can be found [here](https://unit-gw2.github.io/eos).
