# Getting Started

ToF CM is one of those encounters where it is difficult, if not downright impossible, to find groups in the public LFG. This is due in part to the woeful inadequacy of the LFG, but mostly due to the necessity for voice communication: the fight is difficult to call out or organize via in-game chat, and requires experience and knowledge of specific roles. Therefore, most people interested in running it congregate in external online communities, primarily on [discord](https://discord.com/).

Being full of players who regularly play the encounter, these communities are _incredible_ resources for players looking to get started. There are two discord servers that regularly host public runs:

- The <img class="inline tof_icon"> [Temple of Febe CM](https://discord.gg/tofcm){: .text-red-300 .fw-700} discord server, born after the introduction of the bossfight, and exclusively dedicated to the encounter.

- The <img class="inline vl_icon"> [Void Lounge](https://discord.gg/voidlounge){: .text-purple-000 .fw-700}  discord server, created originally for Harvest Temple Challenge Mode, has since expanded also to ToF CM.

I highly recommend joining one or both of these servers.

## Getting into your first run

Once you are in a server, getting into a run is actually very simple! Firstly, both of the communities above have areas with builds optimized for ToF, created and updated by dedicated members. Once you have a serviceable build, hop over to the progression LFG channels and look for a No Experience run. These are made for people like you! No-exp events are run regularly on both communities by experienced members.

Most commanders will only require that you have an appropriate build for your role, and that you know how to play your class. Just sign up for runs and follow the commanderâ€™s calls, and you will have a blast!

ToF CM is still one of the most challenging endgame encounters! You should have some experience in other endgame content and a decent build before joining any runs.

## Getting into more runs

As you advance further into the encounter and see more mechanics, you will likely want to run with people who have similar experience as yourself. To manage this, most servers use an _experience level_ system: you can submit logs demonstrating your skill, and get assigned _discord roles_ that guarantee your progress to all members of the community. There are various roles with increasing requirements, and more advanced roles are prerequisite to eventually get into runs with players going for the kill.

If you are a dedicated gamer and want to run multiple times a week, you will likely benefit from forming or joining a static group. Most servers will have a dedicated channel where you can find groups looking for new members.
