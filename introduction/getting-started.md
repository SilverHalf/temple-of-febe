# Getting Started

Similarly to other challenging endgame encounters, it can be difficult if not downright impossble to find a group for [ToF](#glossary:ToF) CM in the public [LFG](#glossary:LFG). The complexity of the fight practically mandates voice chat, and consequently most people interested in running the encounter congregate in external online communities, mostly on [discord](https://discord.com/).

There are two primary communities that regularly host public runs:

- The <img class="inline" src="images/introduction/ToF_icon.webp" valign="middle"> [Temple of Febe CM](https://discord.gg/GBWkn3Az){: .text-red-300 .fw-700} discord server was born after the introduction of the bossfight, and is exclusively dedicated to ToF CM.

- The <img class="inline" src="images/introduction/VL_icon.webp" valign="middle"> [Void Lounge](https://discord.gg/UXmjTayf){: .text-purple-000 .fw-700}  discord server was created originally for Harvest Temple Challenge Mode, but has since expanded also to ToF CM.

Both of these communities are _incredible_ resources for players looking to get into ToF, and I would recommend anyone interested in the encounter to join one or both. Click on the icons above to explore them!
