# Getting Started

Temple of Febe Challenge Mode is one of the most difficult encounters in Guild Wars 2, but it is also one of the most fun encounters, and is overall very satisfying and rewarding when played correctly.

Similarly to other challenging endgame content, it can be difficult if not downright impossble to find a group for ToF CM in the public LFG. The complexity of the fight mandates voice chat, and most people interested in running it congregate in external online communities, primarily on [discord](https://discord.com/).

There are two communities that regularly host public runs:

- The <img class="inline tof_icon"> [Temple of Febe CM](https://discord.gg/tofcm){: .text-red-300 .fw-700} discord server, born after the introduction of the bossfight, and exclusively dedicated to the encounter.

- The <img class="inline vl_icon"> [Void Lounge](https://discord.gg/UXmjTayf){: .text-purple-000 .fw-700}  discord server, created originally for Harvest Temple Challenge Mode, has since expanded also to ToF CM.

Both of these communities are _incredible_ resources for players looking to get into ToF, and I highly recommend anyone interested in the encounter to join one or both.
