# Welcome!

This website is currently a work in progress! Lots of content is still waiting to be moved over from the old guide.
If you want to see the old guide, you can find it [here](https://templeoffebe.tiiny.site/).

Temple of Febe CM is a challenging endgame boss fight in Guild Wars 2. The encounter stresses both individual player mechanics, and the squadâ€™s overall coordination, but is also extremely rewarding and fun when played correctly.

The objective of this guide is to be both a launch point for players just starting to get into the encounter, and a reference for more experienced players who want to increase their knowledge.

There are four main sections to this guide:

1. An introduction with information about how to get into ToF CM, including communities and tips for getting into your first run.
2. A full description of every mechanic present in the fight, including effects, mitigation, common strategies, and other useful or interesting information.
3. **TBA:** A brief overview of some commonly used strategies employed by organized groups, and the choices driving them.
4. **TBA:** A detailed play-by-play breakdown of UNIT strat, one of the most used strategies in PUG groups.
