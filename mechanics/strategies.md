# General Strategy Concepts

As mentioned earlier, squads have the choice of which adds to kill during the split phases, which allows them to somewhat influence the overall shape of the encounter. These options are between:
- [Rage], [Regret] or [Envy] in the 80% split phase.
- [Malice], [Gluttony] or [Despair] in the 50% split phase.

### Envy Or Regret

In the **first split phase**, [Rage] isn't a compelling choice, since its difficulty does not increase much when empowered, so it comes down to eiter [Envy] or [Regret].
Strategies that kill [Envy] are usually called _Triple Green_ strategies, since they have to deal with the punishing <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Empowered Regret](aspects/regret.html) mechanic.
Strategies that instead kill [Regret] are called _Double Wall_ strategies, since they will play the <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Empowered Envy](aspects/envy.html) mechanic. [UNIT](../unit/overview.html) strat, one of the most common strategies used by PUG groups, is a Double Wall strategy.

### Gluttony Must Die

In the **second split phase**, most groups will choose to kill <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Empowered Gluttony](aspects/gluttony.html), beacuse of the permanent <img class="inline insatiable"> [Insatiable] stacks.
Most groups will see [Gluttony] at least six times during a normal run, resulting in an average of 9 <img class="inline insatiable"> [Insatiable] stacks per player, if not abusing orb deletion.
This would result in an additional ~3k incoming unavoidable damage per second, which is unmanageable without special builds. Gluttony is usually only kept alive when the squad is attempting [Embodment of Sin](../introduction/lcm.html#embodiment-of-sin).
