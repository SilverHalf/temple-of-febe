# Empowered Stacks

Over the course of the encounter, failing mechanics will often give Cerus stacks of <img class="inline" src="../images/icons/empowered.webp" valign="middle"> [Empowered]. These are **permanent**, and each one **increases Cerusâ€™ damage by 5%**, up to a maximum of 99 stacks, when his attacks additionally become unblockable.

Getting more than 10 stacks before the final phase will make it almost impossible to complete the encounter, due to the difficult healing check. Therefore, stacks should be avoided as much as possible.

## Stack Sources

Stacks can be gained from several of Cerus's skills. Details on these attacks will be provided in further sections of the guide.

- [Insatiable Huger]() - 1-3 stacks every time an orb is not collected.
- [Malicious Intent]() - 5 stacks when a summoned Malice reaches Cerus and is sacrificed.
- [Cry of Rage]() - one stack whenever a player is hit by the AoE.
- [Enraged Smash]() - 3 stacks whenever Cerus uses this attack.
- [Crushing Regret]() - technically 5 stacks whenever there are not enough players in the green, however this will usually wipe the entire squad anyways if it happens.
