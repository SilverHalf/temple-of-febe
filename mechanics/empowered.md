# Empowered Stacks

Over the course of the encounter, failing mechanics will often give Cerus stacks of <img class="inline empowered"> [Empowered]. These are **permanent**, and each one **increases Cerusâ€™ damage by 5%**, up to a maximum of 99 stacks, when his attacks additionally become unblockable.

In Legendary Mode, getting more than 10 stacks before the final phase will make it almost impossible to complete the encounter, due to the difficult healing check. In the normal CM, this mechanic is overall more lenient, but stacks should be avoided anyways as much as possible.

## Stack Sources

Several of Cerus's skills can give him <img class="inline empowered"> [Empowered]. Details on these attacks will be provided in further sections of the guide, but all possible sources are provided below for reference's sake.

- [Insatiable Huger](aspects/gluttony.index) - 1-3 stacks every time an orb is not collected.
- [Malicious Intent](aspects/malice.index) - 5 stacks when a summoned add reaches Cerus and is sacrificed.
- [Cry of Rage](aspects/rage.index) - one stack whenever a player is hit by the AoE.
- [Enraged Smash](other/smash.index) - 2 stacks whenever Cerus uses this attack (3 in legendary mode).
- [Crushing Regret](aspects/regret.index) - 5 stacks whenever there are not enough players in a green.
