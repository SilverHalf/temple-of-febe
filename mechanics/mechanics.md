# Mechanics Breakdown

The basic gameplay in Temple of Febe is centered around managing Cerusâ€™ aspects while maximising the damage the squad is dealing.

The encounter gets progressively more difficult and unforgiving, due in part to recurring mechanics getting stronger in the 80% and 50% split phases, and the Empowered mechanic buffing the boss for each mistake made by the squad.

            <h3>100% - 80%</h3>
            <p>Start of the first phase. Relatively simple and forgiving.</p>

            <h3>80% - 50%</h3>
            <p>The second phase begins after the split. More difficult than the first phase, require some attention to correctly manage sequences.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-component timeline-content">
            <h3>50%</h3>
            <p>Second breakbar and split.</p>

            <h3>50% - 10%</h3>
            <p>Third, more difficult phase. Challenging sequences with little room for error make it easy to lose people or fail mechanics.</p>

        <div class=" timeline-component timeline-content">
            <h3>10% - 0%</h3>
            <p>Final breakbar followed by the most difficult phase. Relentless attacks coupled with a difficult heal and DPS check.</p>
