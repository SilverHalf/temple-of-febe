# Aspects of Cerus

Cerus has six aspects: **Envy**, **Malice**, **Gluttony**, **Despair**, **Rage** and **Regret**. Each aspect corresponds to an its own add that can spawn throughout the fight in fixed locations, shown in the figure below.

Adds are invulnerable except during split phases, and when summoned they will perform a specific attack.

- [Envious Gaze]() - rotating wall that strips boons.
- [Malicious Intent]() - adds spawning on random players.
- [Insatiable Hunger]() - orbs converging on the boss.
- [Wail of Despair]() -  spreads that leave lingering pools.
- [Crushing Regret]() - green circle.
- [Cry of Rage]() - massively damaging AoE.

These attacks are the main mechanic the squad must deal with, so we will be examining them in depth later.

## Stack Sources

Stacks can be gained from several of Cerus's skills. Details on these attacks will be provided in further sections of the guide.

- [Insatiable Huger]() - 1-3 stacks every time an orb is not collected.
- [Malicious Intent]() - 5 stacks when a summoned Malice reaches Cerus and is sacrificed.
- [Cry of Rage]() - one stack whenever a player is hit by the AoE.
- [Crushing Regret]() - 5 stacks whenever there are not enough players in the green.
- [Enraged Smash]() - 3 stacks whenever Cerus uses this attack.

Of these, most squad will gain the most stacks from Gluttony, followed by Malice.
