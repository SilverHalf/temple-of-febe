## Description
<img class="inline empowered_add"> [Rage] and <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Malice] will both require portals to be managed correctly. This puts some strain on the healers, but the rest of the squad should have it relatively easy.

## Normal Sequence
1. Stack in [Regret] south of the boss. When <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Rage] spawns, the <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge] uses their <img class="inline sand-swell"> [Sand Swell] towards the <img class="inline circle"> marker, and the whole squad takes it, then takes it back once the AoE pops.
2. The <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer] opens their <img class="inline cs"> [Continuum Split] and creates a <img class="inline portal"> [Portal] from <img class="inline swirl"> to <img class="inline circle">. Everyone targeted by [Malice] will take this portal and place their add on the edge of the arena.
3. Everyone who did not get [Malice] should stay outside of the Embodiment's <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Rage].
4. Before <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair] starts, everyone should spread in a semi-circle around the boss. Players who stayed on <img class="inline swirl"> should favor spreading more to the left, leaving space for the Malice players once they get back from the portal.
5. Dodge <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair] towards the boss.

## Phasing
There are several points where you can phase during this sequence.

### <img class="inline kinda"> Early during <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Envy]

This will only happen if you have very high damage. In this case, if anybody failed the jump and got stripped by the fast wall, it is likely that the add will maintain <img class="inline alacrity"> [Alacrity](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Alacrity) and <img class="inline quickness"> [Quickness](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Quickness), resulting in a faster, invisible <img class="inline empowered_add">[Envy] in the beginning of the final phase. Players should be ready and aware.

<img class="seq-img" src="../../timelines/images/phasing/seq6/1.svg">

---

### <img class="inline ok"> Before <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Rage]

High damage groups should aim for this window. Once [Regret] spawns, you will get a green leading into the final phase, but this is very easy to deal with.

<img class="seq-img" src="../../timelines/images/phasing/seq6/2.svg">

---

### <img class="inline kinda"> After <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Rage]
This requires a small adaptation: the <img class="inline sand-swell"> [Sand Swell] out of the <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Rage] should be replaced by a <img class="inline cs"> [Continuum Split] <img class="inline portal"> [Portal], so that <img class="inline sand-swell"> [Sand Swell] will be available for the start of the final phase.
If the Embodiment of <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Rage] spawns, remember that it will _always_ cast its attack, even if you phase. Depending on the timing of the attack, the commander may make the call to play the start of the final phase from <img class="inline swirl">.

  <b>Note</b>: in this PoV, the squad dps was not enough to phase during the Rage mechanic, so damage was held in order to phase at the beginning of the following sequence. However, its a good showcase of the CS portal.

### <img class="inline notok"> During <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Malice]
If you phase while <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Malice] tethers are active, the tethers will not disappear, and you will get an extra set of adds persisting through to the next phase. This is extremely inconvenient, since usually the squad will not be ready to cleave them, resulting in a full 15 stacks of <img class="inline empowered"> [Empowered] on the boss, and a wipe. You should generally try to phase Cerus before he puts his wings to the floor, or hold damage and try to phase at the start of the next sequence.

<img class="seq-img" src="../../timelines/images/phasing/seq6/4.svg">

---

### <img class="inline risky"> After <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Malice]
Phasing here will result in the <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Malice] adds despawning. However, you will always get [Gluttony] persisting through the beginning of the final phase. While not catastrophic, this is however a significant increase in difficulty, and should be avoided. You should hold damage and try to phase at the beginning of the next sequence.

## Extra Information
- _Don't_ use <img class="inline distort"> [Distortion] or <img class="inline glint_h"> [Infuse Light] for <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair]: you will need them at the start of the final phase.
- The <img class="inline portal"> [Portal] can be done both from <img class="inline swirl"> to <img class="inline circle"> or from <img class="inline circle"> to <img class="inline swirl">, choose which suits you best.
- Players who don't get targeted by <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Malice] should tend to spread left with their <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair], leaving more space for their teammates once they come back with the portal.
