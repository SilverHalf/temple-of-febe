## Description
A very difficult part of the fight. The squad will naturally tend to separate and spread out due to [Gluttony] and <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Malice], meaning the healers will struggle to keep everyone alive during one of the most stressful series of mechanics.

## Sequence
1. Focus on collecting [Gluttony]. Use <img class="inline feedback"> [Feedback](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Feedback) and <img class="inline cpc"> [Corrosive Poison Cloud](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Corrosive_Poison_Cloud) on the boss to prevent it from gaining <img class="inline barrier"> [Barrier](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Barrier).
2. As soon as <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Malice] tethers spawn, the  <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer] opens their <img class="inline portal"> [Portal] on the boss. Targeted players should wait until they are full health after the smash at ~32s, then take the portal. Drop the adds on the portal exit.
3. Once <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair] spreads spawn, everyone takes the portal and prepares to dodge. The majority of the squad should stack on top of the exit while the healers move behind. Virtuosos should use their <img class="inline thousand"> [Thousand Cuts] now while targeting the boss to cleave the adds.
4. <img class="inline dodge"> Dodge <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair] to the right. <img class="inline virtuoso"> [Virtuosos] use their <img class="inline distort"> [Distortion], <img class="inline herald"> [Heralds] use <img class="inline glint_h"> [Infuse Light].
5. Run east towards <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Envy] and chase the fast wall around the boss.
6. Run to either <img class="inline arrow"> or <img class="inline swirl"> to avoid the slow wall. <img class="inline swirl"> is safer but <img class="inline arrow"> allows melee builds to greed more damage.
7. Stack in [Regret] when it spawns, and sidestep <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Rage].

## Extra Information
- Any players who go down after <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair] and aren't immediately revived should /gg.
- It is important that players targeted by <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Malice] wait until after the smash to take the portal. This will give the healers time to bring them to full health, otherwise they will likely downstate on the smash right after <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair] spreads spawn.
- <img class="inline virtuoso"> [Virtuosos] targeted by <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Malice] should try to <img class="inline block"> [Block] the tethers to reduce incoming damage, since they will be far from their healers when they complete.
- If you are missing some damage, it is best to move to <img class="inline swirl"> after <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Envy], so you can cleave the adds. If they walk in, the squad will die very quickly.
- <img class="inline virtuoso"> [Virtuosos] should provide <img class="inline swiftness"> [Swiftness] with <img class="inline curtain"> [Temporal Curtain] for <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Envy].
