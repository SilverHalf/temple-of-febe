## Description
This sequence is exactly identical to the previous [Envy, Regret, Rage](seq1.html) combination, only with added stress and more difficult healing.
One thing the squad can do is to stack up behind the adds after <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Envy] to cleave them down, but most squads should phase before they become an issue.
