## Description
This sequence is identical to the Gluttony, Malice, Despair at the start of the [previous](seq2.html) sequence.
Here it's do or die: most squads will wipe soon after the final <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair], due to the incredible damage pressure and the inavailablity of portals.

## Sequence
1. Focus on collecting [Gluttony]. Use <img class="inline feedback"> [Feedback](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Feedback) and <img class="inline cpc"> [Corrosive Poison Cloud](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Corrosive_Poison_Cloud) on the boss to prevent it from gaining <img class="inline barrier"> [Barrier](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Barrier). Avoid barrier at all costs: one single orb going in means 4-5 more seconds of dps. That's an extra smash to deal with: often the difference between a kill and a wipe.
2. Players targeted by <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Malice] can try running out. Don't run too far, or else you will quickly die to smashes.
3. If <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair] spawns: spread, dps, pray.
4. [You are dead.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNQs_Bef_V8)
