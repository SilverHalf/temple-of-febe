# Second Phase - 80% to 50%

Two adds, [Envy] and [Rage], will be <img class="inline empowered_add"> **Empowered**, increasing the challenge posed.

- Avoid <img class="inline empowered"> [Empowered] on the boss. Stacks commonly result from miscommunication during [Gluttony] or [Malice].
- The double [Despair] followed by double <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Envy] 75 seconds in is the first true difficulty spike of the encounter.
- During this phase, an Embodiment will spawn and perform their attack every 20 seconds.
