</div>

Cerus will separate into his Aspects, which will start doing attacks. The first attack will almost always be [Gluttony], while the second one and on are random.
- The squad should kill <img class="inline empowered_add">[Regret], so as to disable the Triple Green mechanic.
- Do your full DPS rotation on the add, _never_ skillsave. With enough damage, the squad can skip the second mechanic.
- The two healers and a quickness should go collect Gluttony. Sort out which quickness goes beforehand.
- <img class="inline feedback"> [Feedback] or  <img class="inline cpc"> [Corrosive Poison Cloud] can be used on Gluttony, stopping Cerus from respawning with a small amount of barrier.
- Whoever opened instance should stand _west_ of the squad to bait <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Envy], in case it performs its attack. The rest of the squad should be ready to jump the fast wall.
- The <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge] can <img class="inline sand-swell"> [Sand Swell] from the center of the arena to Regret while returning from collecting. The squad can then take it back once the add is killed.
