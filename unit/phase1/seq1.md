## Description
A simple and straightforward opening sequence. A [Malice] add needs to be placed far from the boss, and [Despair] needs to be dodged.

## Sequence
1. Glide into the arena and stack in the green in front of the boss.
2. Shortly after the green pops, the <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer] activates their <img class="inline cs"> [Continuum Split], prepares a <img class="inline portal"> [Portal] on the group, <img class='inline blink'> [Blinks](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blink) to the North-East corner of the arena, and opens their portal before exiting <img class="inline cs"> [Continuum Split].
3. Everyone spreads to the south with [Despair], and dodges inwards. Whoever is targeted by [Malice] takes the portal and places their add on the edge of the arena, then takes it back after dropping their [Despair].
4. Stack up and sidestep [Envy] to the left once its indicator appears.

## Extra Information
- The add from the [Malice] needs to be placed far enough to the North so as to take advantage of its pathfinding: if the add starts walking directly towards the center, then the portal was outside of the correct zone.
- <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancers] can practice this "CS portal" as it is the easiest moment in which this sequence is performed.

## Legacy Strategy
This was the original form of UNIT strat, which did not rely on any <img class="inline immobile"> [Immobilize](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Immobile), since at the time it was unknown if immobilizing adds was intended and whether it would be patched if not. This version actively positions the squad to kill the add from [Malice] before it becomes an issue.

1. Glide into the arena and stack in the green in front of the boss.
2. Shortly after the green pops, the <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge] places their <img class="inline sand-swell"> [Sand Swell] a bit south of the boss, going southwards. More distance means more time to DPS the add.
3. Everyone takes the portal once [Despair] spreads appear. Spread horizontally, or remain on the portal exit and use  <img class="inline distort"> [Distortion]/<img class="inline glint_h"> [Infuse Light]. Whoever was targeted by [Malice] should stay on the portal exit, so that their add drops in the middle of the squad. <img class="inline dodge"> Dodge _forward_ once [Despair] drops.
4. Stack up behind the add and cleave it down while targeting the boss. Once [Envy] appears, sidestep the wall to the left, then move back behind the add and cleave it down.
