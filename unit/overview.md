# UNIT Strat

This strategy was developed by the homonymous guild for accessibility and role compression in LCM runs. In involves having the two healers manage most of the mechanics, at the cost of more squad movement and less dps uptime.
UNIT is one of the most commonly used strategies for LCM, since it is easy to fill groups, it is overall more forgiving to mistakes, and it frees up strong defensive options for the DPS players.

On the other hand, the entire strategy is built around <img class="inline virtuoso"> [Condition Virtuoso], making it stand head and shoulders above other DPS builds on this encounter, due to its unparalleled ranged cleave and defensive utility.
## General Concepts

Portals throughout the fight are usually done by a heal <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge] with <img class="inline sand-swell"> [Sand Swell] and by a <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer] with <img class="inline portal"> [Portal Entre].

[Malice](../mechanics/aspects/malice.index) is managed by proactively positioning the squad and killing the adds with  <img class="inline virtuoso"> [Condition Virtuoso]'s strong cleave before they reach the boss.

Projectile management is handled by the <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge] and <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer], using <img class="inline cpc"> [Corrosive Poison Cloud] and <img class="inline feedback"> [Feedback].

## Composition
The two subgroups are usually as follows.

First subgroup:
- A heal <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer] providing <img class="inline alacrity"> [Alacrity](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Alacrity), and running <img class="inline feedback"> [Feedback], <img class="inline portal"> [Portal Entre] and <img class="inline blink"> [Blink](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blink).
- A <img class="inline quickness"> [QuickDPS](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Quickness), usually a <img class="inline herald"> [Herald](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Herald), but <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer] also works. The <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer] can also take <img class="inline feedback"> [Feedback], freeing up their healer's slot for <img class="inline woa"> [Well of Action](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Well_of_Action).
- Three <img class="inline virtuoso"> [Condition Virtuoso].

Second subgroup:
- A heal <img class="inline alacrity"> [Alacrity](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Alacrity) <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge] taking <img class="inline cpc"> [Corrosive Poison Cloud], <img class="inline sand-swell"> [Sand Swell] and <img class="inline snake-succ"> [Serpent Siphon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Serpent_Siphon).
- Another <img class="inline quickness"> [QuickDPS](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Quickness) as above.
- Three more <img class="inline virtuoso"> [Condition Virtuoso].

Again, <img class="inline virtuoso"> [Condition Virtuoso] is _by far_ the best DPS build for this encounter, both for utility and for damage (R.I.P <img class="inline deadeye"> [Deadeye](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Deadeye), you will be [missed](https://gw2wingman.nevermindcreations.de/log/29895-20240510-212219_tmplfeb_kill)). This does not mean you cannot use [other builds](https://gw2wingman.nevermindcreations.de/log/YgJz-20240426-202340_cerus), however, it is best that you gain confidence with the fight before attempting to do so.

A final note on <img class="inline virtuoso"> [Condition Virtuoso]: most people will want to use a [modified version](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?PiwAgy3lVwQYKsEmLW6WdxdA-DyQY/o9oLrEaJzxoQaFvA89CIIBx2/tQ/DGUB-e) of the [normal build](https://snowcrows.com/builds/raids/mesmer/condition-virtuoso), which is optimized to use <img class="inline peppercorn"> [Spherified Peppercorn-Spiced Oyster Soup](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spherified_Peppercorn-Spiced_Oyster_Soup) for added survivability. This is extremely important, especially for the final 10% phase in LCM.

## Full Step-By-Step Visualization
The following pages will contain a full playthrough of UNIT strat, where we will provide detailed information covering everything about the encounter when played this way.

For convenience's sake, we will be subdividing each phase into _sequences_: sets of mechanics that logically flow together, where it makes sense to talk about the group instead of the individual. For each phase we will provide an analysis of each sequence, with animations and POVs provided for related roles.
