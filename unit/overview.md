# UNIT Strat

This strategy was developed for accessibility and role compression by having the two healers manage most of the mehcanics, at the cost of more squad movement and less dps uptime.
UNIT is the most commonly used strategy in PUGs, since it is _easy to fill groups_, it is overall _more forgiving to mistakes_, and it frees up _strong defensive options_.

On the other hand, the entire strategy is built around <img class="inline virtuoso"> [Condition Virtuoso], allowing little freedom to play other DPS builds.

## General Concepts

Portals throughout the fight are usually done by a heal <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge] with <img class="inline sand-swell"> [Sand Swell] and by a <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer] with <img class="inline portal"> [Portal Entre].

[Malice](../mechanics/aspects/malice.index) is managed by proactively positioning the squad and killing the adds with  <img class="inline virtuoso"> [Condition Virtuoso]'s strong cleave before they reach the boss.

Projectile management is handled by the <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge] and <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer], using <img class="inline cpc"> [Corrosive Poison Cloud] add <img class="inline feedback"> [Feedback] respectively.

## Composition
The two subgroups are usually as follows.

First subgroup:
- A heal <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer] providing <img class="inline alacrity"> [Alacrity](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Alacrity), and running <img class="inline feedback"> [Feedback], <img class="inline portal"> [Portal Entre] and <img class="inline blink"> [Blink](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blink).
- A <img class="inline quickness"> [QuickDPS](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Quickness), usually a <img class="inline herald"> [Herald](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Herald), but <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer] also works. The <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer] can also take <img class="inline feedback"> [Feedback], freeing up their healer's slot for <img class="inline woa"> [Well of Action](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Well_of_Action).
- Three <img class="inline virtuoso"> [Condition Virtuoso]s.

Second subgroup:
- A heal <img class="inline alacrity"> [Alacrity](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Alacrity) <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge] taking <img class="inline cpc"> [Corrosive Poison Cloud], <img class="inline sand-swell"> [Sand Swell] and <img class="inline snake-succ"> [Serpent Siphon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Serpent_Siphon).
- Another <img class="inline quickness"> [QuickDPS](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Quickness) as above.
- Three more <img class="inline virtuoso"> [Condition Virtuoso]s.

<img class="inline virtuoso"> [Condition Virtuoso] is _by far_ the best DPS build for this encounter, both for utility and for damage (R.I.P <img class="inline deadeye"> [Deadeye](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Deadeye), you will be [missed](https://gw2wingman.nevermindcreations.de/log/29895-20240510-212219_tmplfeb_kill)). While you can use other builds, and it [can work](https://gw2wingman.nevermindcreations.de/log/YgJz-20240426-202340_cerus), make sure that you know what you are doing!

A final note on <img class="inline virtuoso"> [Condition Virtuoso]: most people who run the encounter will want to use a [modified version](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?PiwAgy3lVwQYKsEmLW6WdxdA-DyQY/o9oLrEaJzxoQaFvA89CIIBx2/tQ/DGUB-e) of the [normal build](https://snowcrows.com/builds/raids/mesmer/condition-virtuoso), which is optimized to use <img class="inline peppercorn"> [Spherified Peppercorn-Spiced Oyster Soup](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spherified_Peppercorn-Spiced_Oyster_Soup) for added survivability. This is extremely important, especially for the final 10% phase.

## Full Step-By-Step Visualization
The following pages will contain a full playthrough of UNIT strat, where we will provide detailed information covering everything about the encounter when played this way.

For convenience's sake, we will be subdividing each phase into _sequences_: sets of mechanics that logically flow together, where it makes sense to talk about the group instead of the individual. For each phase we will provide an analysis of each sequence, with animations and POVs provided for each role.
