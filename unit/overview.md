# UNIT Strat

UNIT is the ubiquitous strategy for ToF CM. It was designed to facilitate PUG runs, since it is easy to fill groups, is forgiving to mistakes, and it frees up strong defensive options for the DPS players.

## General Concepts

Most mechanics are compressed into the two healers, ususally a <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge] and <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer]. Portals throughout the fight are provided with <img class="inline sand-swell"> [Sand Swell] and <img class="inline portal"> [Portal Entre], projectile management with <img class="inline cpc"> [Corrosive Poison Cloud] and <img class="inline feedback"> [Feedback], and the <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge] can also <img class="inline immobile"> [Immobilize] using <img class="inline necro_three_dagger"> [Dark Pact].

[Malice](../mechanics/aspects/malice.index) is managed by proactively positioning the squad and killing the adds, facilitated using ranged cleaving classes such as <img class="inline virtuoso"> [Condition Virtuoso].

Variants involve using a single <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer] to provide all portals, or running an alacrity/dps <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge] with <img class="inline sand-swell"> [Sand Swell], freeing up the second healer spot.

## Composition
The typical squad composition looks like this:

First subgroup:
- A heal <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer] providing <img class="inline alacrity"> [Alacrity](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Alacrity), and running <img class="inline feedback"> [Feedback], <img class="inline portal"> [Portal Entre] and <img class="inline blink"> [Blink](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blink). Chronomancer is ubiquitous in this fight, since it can cover most portals, if not all, and brings strong healing and boons as well.
- A <img class="inline quickness"> [QuickDPS](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Quickness), usually a <img class="inline herald"> [Herald](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Herald), but <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer] also works. The <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer] can also take <img class="inline feedback"> [Feedback], freeing up their healer's slot for <img class="inline woa"> [Well of Action](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Well_of_Action). Usually Heralds are more common due to them being significantly easier and providing better boon coverage.
- Three DPS.

Second subgroup:
- A heal <img class="inline alacrity"> [Alacrity](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Alacrity) <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge] taking <img class="inline cpc"> [Corrosive Poison Cloud], <img class="inline sand-swell"> [Sand Swell] and <img class="inline snake-succ"> [Serpent Siphon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Serpent_Siphon). Scourge provides excellent boon coverage, strong healing and barrier for the final phase, and excellent utility.
- Another <img class="inline quickness"> [QuickDPS](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Quickness) as above.
- Three DPS.

DPS isn't extremely important outside of the legendary mode, however, the strategy strongly favours ranged builds with cleave and good personal defensive skills, and the phase length favours condition builds, meaning that  <img class="inline virtuoso"> [Condition Virtuoso] is the safest and best performing build for this encounter. This does not mean you cannot use [other builds](https://gw2wingman.nevermindcreations.de/log/YgJz-20240426-202340_cerus), however, it is best that you gain confidence with the fight before attempting to do so.

## Full Step-By-Step Visualization
The following pages will contain a full playthrough of UNIT strat, where we will provide detailed information covering everything about the strategy.

For convenience's sake, we will be subdividing each phase into _sequences_: sets of mechanics that logically flow together, where it makes sense to talk about the group instead of the individual. For each phase we will provide an analysis of each sequence, with animations and POVs provided for related roles.
