# UNIT Strat

UNIT, named after the guild who originally developed it, is the ubiquitous strategy for ToF CM. It was designed to facilitate PUG runs, since it requires few specialized roles, is relatively forgiving to mistakes, and it frees up strong defensive options for DPS players.

The downside of this strategy is that it forces most of the squad to play certain predifined builds, without much space for alternative playstyles.

## General Concepts

UNIT compresses almost all mechanics into the two heal roles, which are usually covered by a <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge] and <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer]. Both of these classes bring strong utility that is used to manage many of Cerus's attacks:

- <img class='inline empowered'> [Rage] is avoided by transporing the squad out of range using <img class="inline sand-swell"> [Sand Swell] and <img class="inline portal"> [Portal Entre].
- <img class='inline empowered'> [Malice] is mitigated by dropping the adds on the edge of the arena using portals, then either killing them, immobilizing them using <img class="inline necro_three_dagger"> [Dark Pact], or phasing before they become an issue.
- <img class='inline empowered'> [Regret] is killed during the first split phase so that it becomes trivial.
- <img class='inline empowered'> [Gluttony] is killed during the second split phase, and projectile reflection is provided by <img class="inline cpc"> [Corrosive Poison Cloud] and <img class="inline feedback"> [Feedback]. Additionally, both healers can delete orbs using <img class="inline blink"> [Blink](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blink) and <img class='inline necro_three'> [Path of Gluttony](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Path_of_Gluttony).
- <img class='inline empowered'> [Envy] is managed using some positioning tricks that take advantage of portals.
- <img class='inline empowered'> [Despair], especially in its empowered state, benefits from using portals to place the dangerous pools far from the boss.

## Composition
The typical squad composition looks like this:

First subgroup:
- A heal <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer] running <img class="inline feedback"> [Feedback], <img class="inline portal"> [Portal Entre] and <img class="inline blink"> [Blink](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blink).
- A <img class="inline quickness"> / <img class='inline alacrity'> [BoonDPS](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Quickness).
- Three DPS.

Second subgroup:
- A heal <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge] taking <img class="inline cpc"> [Corrosive Poison Cloud], <img class="inline sand-swell"> [Sand Swell] and <img class="inline snake-succ"> [Serpent Siphon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Serpent_Siphon).
- A <img class="inline quickness"> [QuickDPS](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Quickness).
- Three DPS.

Common choices for boon providers include <img class="inline herald"> [Herald](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Herald) and <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer] due to their defensive utilities, with <img class="inline herald"> [Herald](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Herald) being more common due to its easier playstyle and better boon coverage.

DPS isn't extremely important outside of the legendary mode, however, the strategy strongly favours ranged builds with cleave and good personal defensive skills. <img class="inline virtuoso"> [Condition Virtuoso] is by far the safest and best performing build for this strategy. This does not mean you cannot use other builds, however, it is best that you gain confidence with the fight before attempting to do so.

Most groups will run with 4-6 virtuosos, since their cleave is required to kill [Malice] adds safely.

## Full Step-By-Step Visualization
The following pages will contain a full playthrough of UNIT strat, where we will provide detailed information covering everything about the strategy.

For convenience's sake, we will be subdividing each phase into _sequences_: sets of mechanics that logically flow together, where it makes sense to talk about the group instead of the individual. For each phase we will provide an analysis of each sequence, with animations and POVs provided for related roles.
