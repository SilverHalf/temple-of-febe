Cerus will again separate into his Aspects, which will start doing attacks. The first attack will almost always be <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Gluttony], while the second one and on are random.
- Kill <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Gluttony].
- Do your full DPS rotation on the add, _never_ skillsave.
- In Legendary Mode, you _should not_ collect orbs. Any <img class="inline empowered"> [Empowered] gained by Gluttony will be lost once it dies. In normal CM, you instead _should_ collect, since the <img class="inline insatiable"> [Insatiable] will wear off before it becomes an issue.
- In LCM, Healers can delete orbs and use <img class="inline feedback"> [Feedback] or  <img class="inline cpc"> [Corrosive Poison Cloud] to reduce the amount of <img class="inline barrier"> [Barrier] gained by Cerus.
- Whoever opened instance should stand _south_ of the squad to bait <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Envy], in case it performs its attack. The rest of the squad should be ready to jump the fast wall.
