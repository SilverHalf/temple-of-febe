## Sequence

1. The <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge] uses their <img class="inline sand-swell"> [Sand Swell] south to the add as soon as the <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Rage] indicator appears.
2. Everyone stays stacked up behind the add and cleaves it down.
3. [Regret]'s green will spawn while everyone is still stacked.
4. You should be phasing shortly after the green. Otherwise, you will have to play a final [Despair]

## Extra Information
With good damage, it is possible to phase during <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Rage], either the Cerus's or the Aspect's. In this case the boss' Rage will be effectively cancelled as soon as he gains his <img class="inline defiance bar"> [Defiance Bar](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defiance_bar), becoming purely visual. However, _the Aspect will continue casting until the defiance bar is broken_.
