# Phasing to the Final 10%

Once you finish the second [Double Drops](phase3/seq5.html) sequence, you are within range of phasing and you should start planning out when exactly to transition to the final 10%. This is not a straightforward matter: some Embodiment attacks will carry over into the following phase through the breakbar, possibly making the start of the final phase much more difficult, and potentially compromising the entire run. In particular, when the breakbar appears:
- Most attacks originating from the boss will be completely interrupted.
- Any Aspects that have already spawned will finish casting their ability.
- [Malice] tethers will not disappear, but any adds already present will despawn.
- Any [Gluttony] orbs already present will despawn.

We can divide the final part of the fight into several sections based on phasing convenience:

<img class="seq-img" src="../timelines/images/phasing/full.svg">

- <span style="color:00d412">Green</span> sections represent periods where the phasing is more convenient. Carried over mechanics will be inconsequential, or difficult mechanics will be cancelled.
- <span style="color:yellow">Yellow</span> sections have a small amount of added difficulty or deviations from normal strategy that require adaptation on the fly.
- <span style="color:orange">Orange</span> sections are inconvenent timings that should be avoided, but are not run-ending.
- <span style="color:red">Red</span> sections represent bad timings that should be avoided at all costs.

Over the next few pages we will see the final couple of sequences for the third phase, with added annotations about possible phase timings.
