## Description
One of the most difficult sequences of the fight.

Two successive sets of <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair] need to be placed far from the boss. While placing them, the squad must also dispatch two sets of <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Malice], one from the previous sequence, and another that spawns smack in the middle of the two Despairs. Dodging the Despairs correctly has somewhat of a learning curve, and is very punishing on failure.

Once the Despair have been placed, the squad must then deal with a double <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Envy] with some [Regret] sprinkled in for extra flavour.

## Sequence
1. Form a line in preparation for <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair] while cleaving the adds from the previous sequence. All <img class="inline virtuoso"> [Virtuosos] should stack just in range of the boss, in front of <img class="inline triangle"> Triangle. <img class="inline herald"> [Heralds] should be in front of them, while the <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge] and <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer] remain behind everyone else.
2. When the <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair] spreads drop, <img class="inline dodge"> [Dodge](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Evade) them towards <img class="inline square"> Square. Virtuosos should use their <img class="inline distort"> [Distortion] to ignore the initial damage, the Chronomancer and Heralds should save their defensive skills for the second drop.
3. Players will get targeted by <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Malice] during Despair. Everyone who is targeted should take care to drop their add on <img class="inline square"> Square. The tighter the adds are grouped up, the easier it will be to kill them. 
4. Prepare for the second set of <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair]. Virtuosos should reset their <img class="inline distort"> [Distortion] with <img class="inline illusions"> [Signet of Illusions] and stack with the Heralds on square. Heralds should swap to <img class="inline glint"> [Legendary Dragon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_Dragon_Stance). Healers should remain off stack, usually a bit to the north of the rest of the squad, or to the right looking at the boss.
5. Dodge the second set of despair forward. Virtuosos should use their <img class="inline distort"> [Distortion], Heralds should use <img class="inline glint_h"> [Infuse Light].
6. Stack in [Regret] and cleave the adds while targeting the boss. Virtuosos should use their <img class="inline thousand"> [Thousand Cuts] now.
7. <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Envy] will spawn from the add. <img class="inline jump"> Jump the fast wall, then once the adds die move to <img class="inline arrow"> Arrow to avoid the slow wall.
8. A second <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Envy] will spawn from the boss. Run to the right and follow the fast wall around the boss.

## Extra Information
- Remember that <img class="inline distort"> [Distortion] and <img class="inline dodge"> [Evasion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Evade) only work for the initial <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair] damage. 
- DO NOT DODGE EARLY! Early dodges will leave your pool at the end of your dodge, potentially killing your teammates. Wait for the spreads to drop, using your defensive skills on the inital damage, and then use your dodge to get out of the pool faster. You have about a second to get out before you down.
- <img class="inline glint_h"> [Infuse Light] also works on the pools, so heralds can be even more patient. They don't even need to dodge.
- For the first set of spreads, the <img class="inline chrono"> [Chronomancer] can stack far off group and then <img class="inline blink"> [Blink] to <img class="inline square"> Square after they drop, giving a bit more space to the others.
- After the second dodge, the pools on the left facing the boss are purely visual. Don't hesitate to walk through them to cleave the <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Malice].
- The adds will die relatively easily in normal CM. In Legendary Mode, it is crucial that all <img class="inline virtuoso"> [Virtuosos] save their <img class="inline thousand"> [Thousand Cuts] and use it on the second set of Malices. Similarly it is also extremely important that everyone stacks precisely on <img class="inline square"> Square so that they are neatly stacked far from the boss.
- <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge] players can cast their <img class="inline revive"> [Garish Pillar] immediately after the second dodge to save anyone who downed in the pools.
- After jumping the fast wall, support players should cleanse conditions, strip boons from Cerus and re-apply boons on the squad in case anyone failed their jump.
