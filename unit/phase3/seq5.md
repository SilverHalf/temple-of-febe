## Description
Another pair of <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair] need to be placed far from the boss. While placing them, the squad must also deal with a set of <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Malice].

The sequence also features challenging overlaps between <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair] and <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Envy], and [Gluttony] and <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Envy].

## Sequence
1. As soon as <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Malice] chooses targets, everyone quickly takes the <img class="inline portal"> [Portal] to <img class="inline xmarks">. The players targeted by tethers should drop the adds on top of the portal exit.
2. Spread with <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair] along the northern edge of the arena. Take all the space you need, and then <img class="inline dodge"> dodge forward. You should not be in more than 2/3 spreads at this time.
3. Stack inside [Regret] while in range of the boss. The adds will walk into your cleave, so there is no need to focus them specifically.
4. The <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge], if they don't have the green, can move in front and to the left of the stack. As soon as the second <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair] spawns, they <img class="inline sand-swell"> [Sand Swell] behind the boss, immediately taking it back.
5. The squad stacks to the right of the portal, leaving enough space in front of them for the healers. Prepare to dodge the second set of despair. Virtuosos should use their <img class="inline distort"> [Distortion], Heralds should use <img class="inline glint_h"> [Infuse Light].
6. The indicator for <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Envy] from the boss will appear on top of the squad  while the it is stacked. Dodge the <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair]  to the left, and take the <img class="inline sand-swell"> [Sand Swell] to avoid the wall.
7. Chase the fast wall around the boss and run back to <img class="inline heart"> in time for the add's <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Envy]. When it spawns, follow the slow wall to <img class="inline arrow"> and jump the fast wall.
8. [Gluttony] will happen while the slow wall is still up. You may have to go through the wall to collect orbs.

## Extra Information
- If everyone takes the <img class="inline portal"> [Portal] immediately once it opens, no-one will be in range for the second <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Malice], and you will have to deal with one less mechanic. If some players do get tethers, they should try to place their adds on top of the previous set.
- Remember that <img class="inline distort"> [Distortion] and <img class="inline dodge"> [Evasion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Evade) only work for the initial <img class="inline empowered_add"> [Despair] damage,  <img class="inline glint_h"> [Infuse Light] however also works on the pools, so the <img class="inline herald"> [Heralds] don't even need to dodge.
- The <img class="inline scourge"> [Scourge] can spam Interact (default F key) to instantly take their <img class="inline sand-swell"> [Sand Swell] back after casting it.
- After jumping the fast wall, support players should cleanse conditions, strip boons from Cerus and re-apply boons on the squad in case anyone failed their jump.
